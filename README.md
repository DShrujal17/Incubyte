# 🚗 Car Dealership Inventory System

A full-stack, mobile-responsive Car Dealership Inventory System built using **Spring Boot**, **React**, and **PostgreSQL** following **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** principles.

Developed feature-by-feature using the **Red → Green → Refactor** TDD workflow with frequent, descriptive Git commits.

## 🌐 Live Demo (Deployed on Render)

- **Live Web Application (Frontend)**: [https://car-dealership-frontend-iid2.onrender.com](https://car-dealership-frontend-iid2.onrender.com)
- **Backend API**: [https://car-dealership-backend-c7tn.onrender.com](https://car-dealership-backend-c7tn.onrender.com)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Since the application is hosted on Render's free tier, the backend services spin down after periods of inactivity. As a result, the **first request may take some time** (typically 1-2 minutes) to spin up and respond.

> [!NOTE]
> **Default Admin Account** (pre-seeded):
> - **Email**: `admin@gmail.com`
> - **Password**: `admin123`

# ✨ Features

## 🔐 Authentication & Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

### Registration & Seeding
- User Registration (stores role `USER` by default)
- Password Encryption (BCrypt)
- **Default Admin Account Seeding**: Automatically seeded on startup:
  - **Email**: `admin@gmail.com`
  - **Password**: `admin123`
  - **Name**: `adminUser`
  - **Role**: `ADMIN`

### Login & Route Guards
- JWT Token Generation on Login
- JWT Signature Validation and Claim Extraction
- `JwtAuthenticationFilter` — intercepts every request and sets the Security Context
- Custom Authentication Entry Point (Stateless `401 Unauthorized` responses)
- Frontend Login Form with controlled inputs and error handling
- JWT Token and Role persistence in `localStorage`
- Protected Routes — redirects to `/login` if no valid token

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- `GET` endpoints accessible to **all authenticated users** (both `USER` and `ADMIN`)
- `POST /purchase` accessible to **all authenticated users**
- `POST /restock`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` on vehicles restricted to **`ADMIN`** only
- Frontend dynamically shows/hides action buttons based on the user's role

---

## 🚗 Vehicle Management (CRUD) — Admin Only

- **Add Vehicle**: Admin opens a modal form to add vehicles (Make, Model, Year, Price, Category, Quantity, Status)
- **Edit Vehicle**: Admin edits vehicle details with inline validations (positive price, valid year ≥ 1886)
- **Delete Vehicle**: Admin deletes via a custom confirmation modal
- **Auto-Refresh**: Table updates in real-time after every CRUD operation

---

## 🔍 Filter-Wise Vehicle Search & Filtering

- **Sleek Filter-Wise Search Bar**: Features interactive filter pills (`Make`, `Model`, `Category`, `Price Range`, `Advanced`) so users can search filter-by-filter without visual clutter on mobile or desktop.
- Backend uses **JPA Specifications** for case-insensitive, partial-match queries.
- Filters can be combined or used individually via advanced mode.
- **Search** and **Reset** buttons for full control.

---

## 📱 True Responsive Mobile UI & Phone Experience

- **Responsive Card Layout (`≤ 768px`)**: On mobile devices and phones, inventory items and sales records automatically transform into clean, touch-friendly **Vehicle Cards** showing status badges, price, quantity, and full-width action buttons.
- **Desktop Table View (`> 768px`)**: Automatically renders the clean multi-column data table on larger screens.
- **Responsive Navigation & Modals**: All modals, forms, and headers adapt smoothly across mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports.

---

## 🛒 Inventory Management (Purchase & Restock)

### Buy Now (User Role)
- Every authenticated user sees a **"Buy Now"** button on available vehicles
- Purchasing decrements the vehicle's quantity by 1
- When quantity reaches **0**, status is automatically set to **`SOLD`**
- Attempting to purchase a sold-out vehicle returns `400 Bad Request` with a clear error message
- A **toast notification** confirms the action result to the user

### Restock (Admin Role)
- Admins see a **"Restock"** button alongside Edit and Delete
- Clicking opens a modal to enter the quantity to add
- Restocking increases the quantity and automatically changes status back to **`AVAILABLE`** if it was `SOLD`
- Toast notification confirms success

---

## 📊 Sales Tracking & Purchase History
- **My Purchases (User Role)**: Users see a dedicated tab listing all vehicles they have bought, including the purchase price and exact purchase date.
- **Sales History (Admin Role)**: Admins see a master dashboard tab of all sales records made by all users, including the buyer's email, make, model, year, paid price, and timestamp.
- Every successful vehicle purchase automatically logs a permanent `Sale` record in the database.

# 🚀 Quick Start (Docker - Recommended)

The easiest way to run the entire application (PostgreSQL Database, Spring Boot Backend, and React Frontend) is using Docker Compose.

## 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DShrujal17/Incubyte.git
cd car-dealership-inventory
```

## 2. Run with Docker Compose
Ensure Docker Desktop is running on your machine, then execute:
```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

That's it! The services will be available at:
* **Frontend**: `http://localhost:1308`
* **Backend API**: `http://localhost:8080`
* **Database**: `localhost:5432`

---

# 🛠️ Manual Setup (Without Docker)

If you prefer to run the services natively instead of using Docker, follow the instructions below.

## Root Level Startup
You can launch both the Spring Boot backend and React dev frontend concurrently using a single command:
```bash
npm install
npm run start
```
*(Requires local PostgreSQL to be configured in `application.properties` first).*

---

# ⚙️ Backend Setup

## 1. Navigate to Backend

```bash
cd car-dealership-inventory/backend
```

## 3. Configure PostgreSQL

Create a PostgreSQL database (e.g. `incubyte`), then update `src/main/resources/application.properties`:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/incubyte
spring.datasource.username=postgres
spring.datasource.password=your_postgres_password

spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
```

> The `vehicles` table requires `category` (VARCHAR) and `quantity` (INTEGER) columns. If migrating from an older schema, run:
> ```sql
> ALTER TABLE vehicles ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS category VARCHAR(255);
> ALTER TABLE vehicles ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS quantity INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
> ```

## 4. Run Backend

```bash
.\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
```

Backend runs on: `http://localhost:8080`

## 5. Run Backend Tests

```bash
.\mvnw.cmd test
```

---

# 💻 Frontend Setup

## 1. Navigate to Frontend

```bash
cd car-dealership-inventory/frontend
```

## 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## 3. Run Dev Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Frontend runs on: `http://localhost:5174` (or `5173` depending on port availability)

## 4. Run Frontend Tests

```bash
npx vitest run
```
